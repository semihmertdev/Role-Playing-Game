# Basic JavaScript RPG Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Basic JavaScript RPG project!

In this project, I've created a simple Role Playing Game (RPG) using JavaScript. I wanted to learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript, so I decided to build this RPG as a fun way to practice.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned a lot about JavaScript programming. Here are some of the key concepts I mastered:

- Working with arrays: I learned how to use arrays to store and manipulate data in my RPG.
- Manipulating strings: I discovered various techniques to manipulate strings to enhance the gameplay experience.
- Utilizing objects: Objects were crucial for representing characters, items, and other elements in my RPG.
- Defining and using functions: Functions allowed me to organize my code and perform specific tasks efficiently.
- Implementing loops: Loops were essential for iterating over arrays and performing repetitive tasks in my RPG.
- Employing if/else statements: I used if/else statements to control the flow of the game and make decisions based on certain conditions.

## How to Run the Game

To run the game, simply open the 'index.html' file in your web browser. That's it! You can start playing the RPG right away and immerse yourself in the adventure.

Feel free to explore the code in the 'js' folder to see how I implemented various features and functionalities. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.

Happy gaming and happy coding! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
